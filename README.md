Overview :
We have developed a website for the IUT Computer Society (IUTCS) that features an engaging and informative landing page. This Landing page provides a comprehensive overview of the Computer Society, including its activities, events, achievements, and more. The website includes a dedicated Blog page where articles can be posted to highlight the society's accomplishments. The Events page is divided into two sections: Inter and Intra university events, where users can access detailed information about upcoming and ongoing events and register for participation.

One of the key features of the website is the Admin Panel, which allows administrators to log in using their credentials.
### Current credentials for the Admin (Username : admin   Password : admin)
From the admin panel, they can create, edit, or delete achievements, blogs, and activities. Additionally, administrators can access participant lists for both Intra and Inter-university events organized through the website.

The website also incorporates an Email Notification system to relay the competition information to all participants. A dedicated Executive Committee page showcases the current team of executives who are working diligently to enhance IUTCS. The About Us page provides insight into the society's history, mission, and its core goals. The Achievements page is designed to highlight the society's notable accomplishments, while the Activities page provides information on ongoing, upcoming, and past events hosted by IUTCS.

Lastly, the website includes a Leaderboard page that displays the status of competitions.
